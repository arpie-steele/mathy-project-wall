# Extracting the Feigenbaum Constants

The logistic map, indeed all one dimensional maps with a single
quadratic maximum, has period-doubling bifurcations as the parameters
move from periodic behavior to chaos. This period-doubling is
associated with a universal behavior which is characterized in the
limit by the Feigenbaum constants.
